      <description>Bavaria is the debatably the strongest state in Germany in terms of economy. Various industries zare based in this state. World famous brands such as Mercedes and BMW are from Bavaria. Therefore, seeking flow of investment from Germany shall no doubt require attracting investment from the Bavaria state.
On the other hand, Ethiopia is largely liberalizing many of its sectors including telecom, power, banking and transport etc. Owing to predominant command economic structures that prevailed for almost half a century, the share the private sector in its economy is very limited.</description>

      <description>Ethiopian coffee is one of the best coffees sold at premium price in the world market. However, the return from the sales does not necessarily get back to the actual growers, coffee traders and exporters.
This is due to absence of value addition in the coffee supply chain. The majority of Ethiopian coffee is being sold raw as green beans. Therefore, an immediate intervention is required in the coffee processing value chain.</description>
